# CS61A spring 2022

## introduce

This is my solution of CS61A in spring 2022 about  homework, lab, discussion, project. But **I don't finish scheme_stubbed and scheme_contest** in project and **some discussions not record**.
I test some examples in chapter and give some my personal solution of exercise in lecture.
if you find some file's names of **"demo.py"** that is my test program, **you can ignore them**.

## **course introduce**

An introduction to programming and computer science focused on abstraction techniques as means to manage program complexity. Techniques include procedural abstraction; control abstraction using recursion, higher-order functions, generators, and streams; data abstraction using interfaces, objects, classes, and generic operators; and language abstraction using interpreters and macros. 
The course exposes students to programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and declarative approaches. It includes an introduction to asymptotic analysis of algorithms. There are several significant programming projects.
